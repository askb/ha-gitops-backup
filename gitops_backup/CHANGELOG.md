# Changelog

## 0.3.0

- Feature: `apply_after_pull` — after a merged PR is pulled into `/config`, the
  app now applies it to the running Home Assistant instead of leaving files
  on disk unloaded. Default `reload` calls `homeassistant.reload_all` (no
  restart); `restart` restarts HA (for `configuration.yaml` integration or
  `custom_components/` changes); `off` keeps the previous behaviour. Only fires
  when the sync actually advanced `HEAD`, never in `dry_run`. Requires the
  app's Home Assistant API access (now enabled via `homeassistant_api`).

## 0.2.1

- Security: the never-commit guarantee (secrets, credentials, `.storage/`,
  app runtime files) now holds for **migrated** repos too, not just fresh
  ones. Patterns are enforced via `.git/info/exclude` on every run, and any
  secret a prior run already committed is untracked (the removal flows out
  through the next backup PR). Previously a repo that arrived with its own
  `.gitignore` lacking these entries could leak an OAuth token or key.

## 0.2.0

- Docs: make the two-pillar backup model explicit — config repo (this app)
  + encrypted HA full backup (e.g. Google Drive Backup) = 100% restorable;
  neither alone is enough. Sharpened the "what is backed up where" table
  (names exactly what `.storage/` holds and what lives outside `/config`).
- Security: seed `.gitignore` now also excludes `*.token` / `.google.token`
  so OAuth tokens (e.g. Google Calendar) never land in the repo.
- First bootstrap now logs a disaster-recovery warning: this app versions
  declarative config only; run HA full backups for a complete restore.

## 0.1.1

- Fix: keep the app's own runtime files (`.gitops_backup_status`,
  `gitops_backup.log`) out of backups when migrating a repo that already has a
  `.gitignore` — they were previously swept into backup PRs and risked a
  status-file PR feedback loop. Now excluded via `.git/info/exclude` on every
  run, and untracked if a prior run committed them.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: PR-gated backup (stash → rebase → drift → branch → PR),
  dry-run mode, DCO sign-off, seeded HA `.gitignore`, status file for a
  `command_line` sensor, template CI workflow for the config repo.
